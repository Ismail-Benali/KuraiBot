## KuraiBot

KuraiBot is a powerful Python script designed to facilitate volumetric attacks with spoofed IP addresses. This tool is intended for educational purposes only and should be used responsibly in controlled environments with proper authorization. 

### Features:
- **IP Address Spoofing:** KuraiBot generates random IP addresses to spoof the source of each UDP packet, enhancing anonymity and making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack.
- **Customizable Target:** Users can specify the target IP address and port via the terminal, providing flexibility in target selection.
- **Multithreaded Execution:** Leveraging threading, KuraiBot sends multiple packets simultaneously to maximize the impact of the attack.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear prompts and instructions make it easy for users to initiate the attack and monitor its progress.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the KuraiBot script.
3. Run the script and follow the prompts to input the target IP address and port.
4. Sit back and watch as KuraiBot initiates the volumetric attack with IP address spoofing.

### Disclaimer:
KuraiBot is intended for educational and research purposes only. Misuse of this tool for malicious activities is strictly prohibited. The developer(s) assume no liability for any damages caused by the misuse of this script.
