KuraiBot
KuraiBot is a powerful Python script that enables users to initiate volumetric attacks with spoofed IP addresses. This tool is designed for educational purposes and should only be used in controlled environments with proper authorization. KuraiBot utilizes multithreading to send a high volume of UDP packets to the target IP address and port, simulating a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.

Features:
IP Address Spoofing: KuraiBot generates random IP addresses to spoof the source of each UDP packet, making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack.
Customizable Target: Users can specify the target IP address and port via the terminal, allowing for flexibility in target selection.
Multithreaded Execution: KuraiBot leverages threading to send multiple packets simultaneously, maximizing the impact of the attack.
User-Friendly Interface: With clear prompts and instructions, KuraiBot makes it easy for users to initiate the attack and monitor its progress.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the KuraiBot script.
Run the script and follow the prompts to input the target IP address and port.
Sit back and watch as KuraiBot initiates the volumetric attack with IP address spoofing.
Disclaimer:
KuraiBot is intended for educational and research purposes only. Misuse of this tool for malicious activities is strictly prohibited. The developer(s) assume no liability for any damages caused by the misuse of this script.
